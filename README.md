# MaterialComponentsWeb
Pharo/Smalltalk code to use material-components-web in Seaside.

NOTE:

Since there will be no further releases of Material Components Web from Google (see: https://github.com/material-components/material-web/issues/3050#issuecomment-1011464627), work has ceassed on this repository. A migration to Quasar Framework was done, and the initial version of the code is in the v0 version of this repository. The Quasar work will continue in the Seaside-Quasar repository.
